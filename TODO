fix player/planets index after feeding (e.g. with mysql)
muffin Feed+Mangle (Upload+Download) filter
trade tool listing players with $TAs<n  and A$+PP>15k
include battles.csv 7-day history in alliancerelation-detector
#better idle-time tracking (start-end)
anon export for relations
fleets (and others) with local times instead of GMT. not for BB-export
fleet tracker
correlate strongest fleet to best guarded
merge strongest fleets history to catch moving fleets or see growth/loss
#RSA thread link - auto from referer. e.g. use $::planetinfo{"$sid#0"}
#add battlecalc link to relations - def/att from race or just worst-case
Arnaken: could you sum up the fleets of everyone ie at the end of the fleet page ?
RSA-TD: Actually you know what I thought of, possible to code the best planets into your tool? As in it will show up where best planets are?

possibly improve muffin AWLink to fetch info from aw.lsmod.de on demand
#muffin: clickable system-IDs in Alliance/Detail (mouseover "AWTools")

If you click on a system and et the system info (in the tools) you would also get a list of which alliance members who could see that particular system.


changing the map look to look more "AW-like" - much like Mob's tools... I really think that would encourage people to use the tools more than they do today...
