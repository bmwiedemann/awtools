changing the map look to look more "AW-like" - much like Mob's tools... I really think that would encourage people to use the tools more than they do today...

-wie wäre es mit einer möglichkeit eine sys ID, einen energylevel und einen biolevwel einzugeben und dann werden alle potentiellen jumper mit weniger als 2h flugzeit gesucht, als optionen kann man alle von aktiven und verbündeten, von kleinen spielermn und free/unknown einzeln filtern lassen

#alliance: add player.trade column
[AF] Teddy_200: another thing too that would be nice is an alliance TA statistics page, with things like average number of TAs in an alliance, Average TR, prehaps date when the members got their TAs etc. Things like that
[AF] Teddy_200: at least if someone got a TA last update it would be marked somehow - that way you would know that player has just "lost" 20kA$...

#first, could it be possible to add starbase CV to defending fleets ? :)
(11:32:29 AM) [NAIN] Rasta31: 2nd, very easy stuff, make a list of all incommings parsed by brownie ordered by arrival time :)

judochop: but something that it keeps the "planest" screen simple, the problem with looking at the other pages of incomming is that you can not see all the incomming and defences in one look, you have to scroll down or write down which is covered or not covered, 


----
Sorry to bother you, but I just first saw your Javascript formulas (http://aw.lsmod.de/jstools.html) today.

I had some questions/suggestions :
- first, about your index page in general, there are 40 links listed. Maybe would it be easier if they were listed in some categories ? (like a category about "maps" in general, with the tac' maps, the systems overviews, etc.)
Anyway, that's up to you.
- about the tools themselves :
* the SB-FS-calc is very nice : could you maybe add an entry for "already existing SB" ? For example, if you already have SB15 on your 4th planet and want to raise it to 19, you'll have to make at least 2 calculations.
* about the PL calculators now : same here, we can calculate how much XP you need to get PLx from PL0, but not how much XP you need to get PLx from PLy. Same problem for the "inverse player level" and the daily updates calculator.
* about the TT calculator : calculating the distance square is always difficult, I know that you have a tool for that also, but :
- either add a link in your jstools as well,
- or you could change it in the way Rasta's tool used to do --> you just enter your sid or coordinates, and the calculator finds the distance square all by itself.

Regards,
monico.
