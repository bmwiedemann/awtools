man/FAQ: it uses known IRs or worst case (att=+4, phys=SL) to calc xCV. you can see the original fleet numbers by pointing your mouse over the line.
battle reports (fed from news screen - keep in DB with alli, pid, sidpid, time, info)

add option: MIDI upon incoming
feed:parse num of SUs and num of Artifacts into DB
#http://aw.lsmod.de/cgi-bin/tradepartners   Then You could also add two more columns: 'AD+artifact_price' and 'new ready(h)' (based on new AD+artifact_price amount).

#Arnaken: could you sum up the fleets of everyone ie at the end of the fleet page ?
-RSA-TD: Actually you know what I thought of, possible to code the best planets into your tool? As in it will show up where best planets are?

#possibly improve muffin AWLink to fetch info from aw.lsmod.de on demand -> brownie
#muffin: clickable system-IDs in Alliance/Detail (mouseover "AWTools")

#If you click on a system and et the system info (in the tools) you would also get a list of which alliance members who could see that particular system.


changing the map look to look more "AW-like" - much like Mob's tools... I really think that would encourage people to use the tools more than they do today...

-wie wäre es mit einer möglichkeit eine sys ID, einen energylevel und einen biolevwel einzugeben und dann werden alle potentiellen jumper mit weniger als 2h flugzeit gesucht, als optionen kann man alle von aktiven und verbündeten, von kleinen spielermn und free/unknown einzeln filtern lassen

#alliance: add player.trade column
[AF] Teddy_200: another thing too that would be nice is an alliance TA statistics page, with things like average number of TAs in an alliance, Average TR, prehaps date when the members got their TAs etc. Thins like that
[AF] Teddy_200: at least if someone got a TA last update it would be marked somehow - that way you would know that player has just "lost" 20kA$...

#first, could it be possible to add starbase CV to defending fleets ? :)
(11:32:29 AM) [NAIN] Rasta31: 2nd, very easy stuff, make a list of all incommings parsed by brownie ordered by arrival time :)

judochop: but something that it keeps the "planest" screen simple, the problem with looking at the other pages of incomming is that you can not see all the incomming and defences in one look, you have to scroll down or write down which is covered or not covered,
