<h1>greenbird's AW Tools manual page</h1>
<h2>Authentication</h2>
Some tools require a special user authentication. That is more than the per alliance authentication for most of the tools.<br/>
<br/>
<b>GE11 update</b>: it is now possible to <a href="/cgi-bin/userpasswd">set a password for a user</a> and log into the tools with that.<br/>
The primary method for user-authentication is to click an AWTools link within <a href="/manual.html#brownie">brownie</a>. <br/>
<span style="color:gray">The other method is to use <a href="/cgi-bin/public/authawforum">AW forum authentication</a> - but that is now disabled by default. you can enable it in <a href="/cgi-bin/preferences2">the preferences2 tool</a></span><br/>
NOTE: for security reasons, this does only work while your IP address stays the same. After a modem reconnect your ISP might assign you a different IP. Then you need to log into AW again with brownie enabled.

<h2>General</h2>
How does Authentication work with brownie/AWTools? How does it know which alliance players belong to?<br>
Brownie uses alliance membership from AW's <code>alliances.csv</code> file.
There is a way to have additional untagged members (useful before PL1 or after reaching 200 points). This is set by those users themselves with the <a href="/cgi-bin/joinalli">joinalli</a> tool and the secret alliance password.
When you click AWTools links from the brownie, a cookie is set in your browser which is then used to authenticate you (because brownie has seen you successfully sign in to AW with it).<br>
You also get a similar cookie from the <a href="/cgi-bin/public/authawforum">authawforum</a> tool (now disabled by default, but you can enable it in <a href="/cgi-bin/public/preferences2">preferences2</a> tool).
