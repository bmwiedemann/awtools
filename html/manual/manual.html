<h1>about</h1>
The AWTools are a collection of <a href="https://github.com/bmwiedemann/awtools">open-source</a> CGIs that you can access in any web-browser. There is also "brownie" - a filtering web-proxy integrated into the AWTools.
Both are designed to enhance the user experience of <a href="http://www.astrowars.com">Astrowars</a> players.

<h1>Tools Access Policy</h1>
Alliances can get AWTools access from me (greenbird). (Guest access is always available and always free)<br />
As you can imagine, coding all these great things took me some months and even after it is written, running and maintaining it costs me some more (both time and money).
<br />So if you want to have access, here is the deal:
<ul>
<li>Either you <a href="http://www.lsmod.de/services/bank">pay me</a> 8.97 Euro/round (that is 2.99 Euro per month) - once for a whole alliance, not for each player. Notice that you should also PM me, because I often can not associate the transferring ID with an AW alliance.

</li>
<li>Or you agree to this political deal: 
Your alliance offers to sign an alliance NAP with my alliance (GE27: AF) who can choose to accept it or decline it.
 If the NAP is accepted, it is valid until either the current round is over or until two days (2d = 48h) after my alliance declared that it cancels the NAP.
Notice that this asymmetry in cancelation is the price you have pay for using my AWTools (if you do not want to pay money). It is also because I can not decide on long term politics for my alliance alone.
Then send me a PM: <form method="post" action="http://www.astrowars.com/forums/privmsg.php">

<br/>
Standard NAP terms:
<ul>
<li>- One should not launch to a system that is inhabited by the other party without getting permission before (call it coordination)</li>
<li>- One should not pass on confidential information of the other party like intelligence reports and plans</li>
<li>- No alliance will help a third party to attack the other alliance, that includes not allowing their planets to be used as airports and includes telling the other party about forced jumps</li>
<li>- All above is valid until end of round (does not include interbeta - that is, after winner is declared)</li>
<li><b style="color:darkred">- for AWTools NAPs, greenbird's alliance may cancel the NAP with 2 days advance notice</b></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr/>
In any case I promise to keep confidential and not pass on alliance-internal data (e.g. fleets, relations, intel), even if we were at war.



<h1>greenbird's AW Tools manual page</h1>
<h2>tactical</h2>
<a href="/cgi-bin/tactical">tactical</a> shows 12x12 pixels per system with each line representing a planet and our status with the owner. See <a href="/cgi-bin/system-info?legend=1">legend</a> for their meanings. A little red bar on the right means, that the planet is sieged. <br />
Find your coordinates by counting the brighter lines (each 10 squares) or by looking at the status bar (works at least with IE and mozilla).
By clicking on a position you get to the <i>system-info</i>
There is also a <a href="/cgi-bin/tactical-large">larger version</a> (redrawn every 6h) which adds <a href="/cgi-bin/planet-info?legend=1">planning status color</a> on the right half.
If you want to see a map from current relations data you use <a href="/cgi-bin/tactical-live">tactical-live</a>

<h2>system-info</h2>
<a href="/cgi-bin/system-info">system-info</a> shows all available data about a system. population, starbase, plans and color-coded relationship with it's owner. Red background-color indicates a siege<br />

Click the edit-planet-icon <img src="/images/aw/edit-planet.gif" alt="edit planet" /> to get to the <i>planet-info</i>.<br />
Click the relations-icon <img src="/images/aw/relations-colored.gif" alt="edit relations + intel" /> to get to the <i>relations</i> of that player.<br />
<img src="/images/aw/profile1.gif" alt="public profile" /> and <img src="/images/aw/profile2.gif" alt="private profile" /> will bring you to the public or personal AW profile of that player.
<br />
system-info also shows all current fleets which are automatically added by brownie or muffin tools (described below). It can also show 24h of fleet movement history.  <br />
There is a BB-export option to post plans in forums and an anonymous-export option which allows you to give access to your view of a single system to someone outside (e.g. for good coordination). Such an access link can be set to expire after a few days at the time of creation.


<a name="planet-info" />
<h2>planet-info</h2>
<a href="/cgi-bin/planet-info">planet-info</a> displays information on one planet - especially about plans about which other alliance members will need to know.<br />
Add your next expansion as "planned by" and change it to "targeted by" with ETA and fleet when you launched. And to "taken by" (or "lost") if you were (not) successful<br />
Nowadays, the transition from planned status to targeted to sieged/taken is done automatically when you feed your fleets with brownie.<br />
Hint: as relative measures of time do not make much sense in plannings, the tools try to automatically convert them to ISO date strings. Following things are converted: "yesterday", "today", "tomorrow", "in 3 days", "in 4 d", "in 27 hours", "in 36 h". Days of week(Tue, Sunday) will also be automatically extended with a date. You are encouraged to use those aforementioned or give an absolute date/time directly.


<h2>relations</h2>
<a href="/cgi-bin/relations">relations</a> (which should rather be called player-info) displays information on one player (TAG, status, uid and all his planet's locations, maybe intel reports) 
and allows you to change the relation status with him. Setting a relation for an alliance tag (e.g. TZAR) automatically counts for all official members that have no overriding entry.

<h2>alliance</h2>
the <a href="/cgi-bin/alliance">alliance</a> tool shows most public information about players. 
The "need" column shows free culture and this is colored in red if some culture is free.
The "intel" column will show races and age of intel reports. 
If available from feeding a player's science page, there will also be an estimated time to culture(ETC, red if ETC&lt;24h). 
<!--Intel report is green if Bio&gt;=25 .-->

<h2>feedupdate</h2>
<a name="feedupdate" />
<a href="/cgi-bin/feedupdate">feedupdate</a>
you can input HTML files from the game here. 
Currently player/profile, map/detail, fleet, news and alliance/detail pages are supported. It will produce more or less informative output, but the real important info is &quot;automagically&quot; added to the plannings or player databases. The modified entries are linked in the output.
<br /> in mozilla you can:
<ul>
<li>Ctrl+U (view source window)</li>
<li>Ctrl+A (select all)</li>
<li>Ctrl+C (copy)</li>
<li>Ctrl+W (close)</li>
<li>open feedupdate and select the large text area</li>
<li>ctrl+V (paste)</li>
</ul>
But the preferred method of feeding the tools is to use brownie or old <a href="#muffin">muffin</a>'s AWUpload or AWMangle

<a name="muffin" />
<h2>muffin</h2>
this part is outdated. see <a href="#brownie">brownie</a> below.<br />
<span style="color:gray">
<!--a href="/muffin-0.9.3a-bmw11.tar.gz">My muffin</a-->
My muffin
is a filtering HTTP proxy, copylefted under GPL and originating from <a href="http://muffin.doit.org">http://muffin.doit.org</a>. <br />
I added two plugins to it: AWUpload and AWLink.<br />
Notice: this section is obsolete now. See <a href="#brownie">brownie</a> below.

As of 2006-01-14 last changes were done for muffin, but as brownie is better in nearly all aspects, brownie is now the recommended proxy to use and future development on muffin code will only include bugfixes. You can find more description in <a href="manual-2007-02-23.html">the old AWTools manual</a>.
</span>


<a name="brownie" />
<h2>brownie</h2>
<pre>brownie usage instructions:
configure your browser to use proxy auto-configuration file <a href="http://aw.lsmod.de/brownie81.pac">http://aw.lsmod.de/brownie.pac</a>
as described in <a href="http://aw.lsmod.de/manual/proxy-config">the proxy configuration guide</a>
end of instructions ;-)</pre>
<p>
As hinted by the name, brownie and muffin are alike to each other... result of this being that you only need to use one of them.
Some of the features (data feeding, color-coding, ETC display) will not work before your user-name is associated with an alliance - either automatically by official alliance tag or manually by the AWTools admin (i.e. greenbird).
<br />
If you can't use the brownie.pac for one reason or another there is one more method of how to use it.
Just

<h3>How does it work</h3>
For the people interested in technology, here is some background info.<br />
The hyper text transfer protocol (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP">HTTP</a>) allows for browsers to use a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server#Web_proxy">proxy server</a> to relay a request for a resource (identified by a Uniform Resource Locator (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL">URL</a>)). 
The proxy usually forwards the request to the original server (some have caches and can answer right away).
This design allows for the proxy to inspect and modify both, the request and the response, which is what brownie code does.<br />
To let proxies work properly with AW it requires another thing: it must not be an anonymous proxy, i.e. it must tell the destination about the original IP. This works by adding the X-Forwarded-For HTTP header to the request with this information.


<h2>Sharing AWTools data with another alliance</h2>
<a name="sharing">
Often enough you are closely cooperating with a nearby alliance (like AF+IS) or your two alliances are in fact one (like AA+XXX), so you wish to increase the benefits of my AWTools by sharing information directly within it.<br/>
This sharing is generally supported. It is possible to share all or only part of information. The parts are: <ol>
<li>fleets (including incomings, movements and defending fleets),</li>
<li>incomings (only fleets marked as "incoming" ; ignored when fleet sharing is enabled)</li>
<li>plans (the ones next to planets)</li>
<li>intel reports (race+sciences, logins)</li>
<li>internal data (ETC, production, saved A$/PP)</li>
<li>online status (what you see in allies online display)</li>
<li>and relations</li>
</ol>
The path to get such sharing is as follows: first, all sharing alliances must qualify for normal AWTools access as detailed in the "Tools Access Policy" section above. 
Now the founder of the alliance can give the other party read access to your data with <a href="http://aw.lsmod.de/cgi-bin/edit-sharing">the edit-sharing tool</a> giving the tag of the other party, checking a few checkboxes and clicking edit. The other founder needs to do the same for you.<br>
Relations are special, because they are only shared when both sides enabled their relations-checkbox.<br>
If the above fails for you, this is the fallback method: I (that is the AWTools admin = greenbird) need confirmation from all sharing alliances that (and what) they want to share with whom (so one party saying they want to share with XYZ is not enough).
This should suffice for me to set up sharing.
